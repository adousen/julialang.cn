# Application Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in the Julia language. Proposals are free form â€“ you can write about your project however you want, but make sure it's clear what it's about, why you're the best person to do it, and how we can contact you.

Some points that you may want to address in your proposal:

1. *The proposal.* What do you want to do?
  - What is the ultimate goal of your proposal?
  - Will your project involve creating a new package, or modifying Base code? If the latter, which parts of the Base library will be modified?
  - What expected interactions will your contribution have to the Base library or other Julia packages?
  - What is your proposed strategy for completing this project?
  - What milestones can you identify that will allow you (and us) to track your progress?
  - How do you plan to wow us with the results at the end of the GSoC season?

2. *Code portfolio.* For us to evaluate you, you _must_ have either:
  - Contributed to the Julia repository already (please mention relevant Github issues or pull request numbers.), or:
  - Show us sample code written in Julia that is relevant to the project you are proposing.  for the former, or links to code for the latter. **This is the most important part of the application, so choose carefully what code samples you think best demonstrate your abilities and skills.**
  - Other code: what other coding projects have you contributed to? Show us a portfolio of other projects you have worked on, e.g. for class projects, hobbies, other open source contributions or other previous work. What have you learned from these projects?

3. *About you.* Why you? Give us a sense of who you are as a person, programmer and computational scientist.
  - What is your academic background and/or work experience?
  - How is your background relevant to the proposed project?
  - Do you have experience specific to technical computing and/or programming language design?
  - Why should we choose you over someone else with similar background and interests?
  - Why are you interested in Julia?
  - How should we contact you? Please list all the following if available: Github handle, email address, IRC nick on freenode.net, Google Chat/Hangout account, other instant messaging account.
  - Your online persona: do you have a webpage, blog or microblog?

4. *Mentors.* Why us?
  - Which Julia developer(s) have you contacted regarding your interest in this project? Please include a URL to the julia-dev mailing list thread or Github issue. (If you had contacted someone by email, just state so.)
  - Who have you identified as possible mentor(s) for your proposal?

5. *Logistics*
  - What other time commitments, such as summer courses, other jobs, planned vacations, etc., will you have between May 19 and August 18?
  - Would you be interested in relocating to the Cambridge, Massachusetts area for part or all of the GSoC season?

Applications must be submitted to the [GSoC 2014 page](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) by *19:00 UTC on Friday, March 21, 2014.*

We're also happy to receive multiple applications from students, but remember that quality is more important than quantity.
